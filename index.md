#GDS Capture

You need to download any python editor (PyCharm recommended) to run this Software
unlike other software you won't be seeing any watermark, lag or fps drop in output.

There's no UserInterface (UI) for this software you'll only deal with some codes on python editor.

its highly recommended to read "readthisfirst.md" on github before you start.

having problems? Im on instagram as @not.gyann && "FirstBloodGyan" on Youtube.

made with passion by GDS Studio.
